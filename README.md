# Revolutionizing Fertility Support in Korea

Gyeongsangbuk-do is poised to revolutionize fertility support in Korea, tackling the nation's low birth rate crisis head-on. By expanding on **Mommytalk's** successful pregnancy and parenting platform, we're creating a game-changing solution for couples struggling with infertility and sub-fertility.

Imagine an Instagram-meets-Experts experience, tailored specifically for aspiring parent(s):

- Bite-sized, scientifically-backed content on nutrition and lifestyle factors
- Personalized recommendations based on individual health data
- A groundbreaking feature that instantly answers "Can I eat this? Or how much is it safe to eat?" for any food

We're not just filling an information gap; we're building a comprehensive ecosystem that seamlessly integrates with hospital visits and empowers users throughout their entire fertility journey. With **Mommytalk's** expansion, we're not only addressing a critical social issue but also tapping into a vast, underserved market of couples desperate for accessible, reliable guidance on their path to parenthood.

**Join us** in reshaping Korea's demographic future and capturing a slice of the booming fertility tech industry.

## Development

To set up and run this project locally, follow the steps below:

### 1. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, install the project dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables

Before starting the development server, you need to set two environment variables:

- `FREEPIK_API_KEY`: Your Freepik API key
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key

You can set these variables by creating a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following content:

```
FREEPIK_API_KEY=your_freepik_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_freepik_api_key_here` and `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual API keys.

### 3. Start the Development Server

Once the environment variables are set, you can start the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server, and you can view the project by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### 4. Building the Project

To create a production-ready build, use:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate the optimized files in the dist directory.
